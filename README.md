# Analytic Model Deployment
This repository contains credit scoring prediction model using random forest algorithm. The model is deployed by using Flask framework. You can run this model by using postman application.<br>
This repository has two folders :<br>

**1. [code](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Analytic-Model-Deployment/tree/master/code)**
- Credit-Score.py : model python.
- flask_app.py : server python to be uploaded on Flask.
- random_forest.pkl : random forest algorithm in pickle.
- request.py : request model in python.<br>

**2. [dataset](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Analytic-Model-Deployment/tree/master/dataset)**
- training.csv : dataset to build the model.

The steps and requirements needed to run the credit scoring prediction will be explained on the next section.

# Getting Started 
To use this credit scoring prediction model, you should have :
1. Postman [install here](https://www.getpostman.com/).
