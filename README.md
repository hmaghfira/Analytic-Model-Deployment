# Analytic Model Deployment
This repository contains model analytics deployment using random forest algorithm. The model is deployed using flask framework. You can run this model by using postman application.<br>
This repository has two folders :
1. [code](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Analytic-Model-Deployment/tree/master/code)
This folder contains several files:
-  Credit-Score.py : model python
- flask_app.py : server python to be uploaded on Flask
- random_forest.pkl : random forest algorithm in pickle 
- request.py : request model in python to generate the algorithm into pickle
2. [dataset](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Analytic-Model-Deployment/tree/master/dataset)
- training.csv : dataset to build the model
3. [img](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Analytic-Model-Deployment/tree/master/img)
- the photos of the steps

The steps and requirement needed will be explained on the next section.

# Getting Started
